            The goal of Bhumi, an NGO for education in India, is to provide
            quality education for children of disadvantaged communities and make
            a difference in the lives of those children. Bhumi is working
            towards providing holistic education and creating sustainable
            livelihoods for 5,000 children in the next ten years. For this we
            focus equally on shelter homes, communities and schools increasing
            impact and sustainability.
